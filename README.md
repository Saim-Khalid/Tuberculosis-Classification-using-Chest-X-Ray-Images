## Scope
Fast and accurate medical diagnoses of tuberculosis is more important than ever. The current computer vision and deep learning technology have made this possible. We applied an EfficientNet model to identify Tuberculosis cases in the test set. After training the model will be able to classify Tuberculosis x-ray images from normal x-ray images.
